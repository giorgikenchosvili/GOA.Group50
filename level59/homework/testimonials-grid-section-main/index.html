        <p class="toptag">  ‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a <br>
          transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up <br>
          for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
          The next 12 <br> weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
          the course, I‚Äôve <br> successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù

        Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp <br> themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
      learning <br> from their experiences was easy.

      <p>
        ‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. <br> The program 
        gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present <br> myself as a capable 
        junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal <br> attention you need from 
        an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ‚Äù

      Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!

      ‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve <br> never written a line of code. I needed <br> some structure from 
    professionals <br> who can help me learn programming <br> step by step. I was encouraged  to <br> enroll by a former 
    student of theirs <br> who can only say wonderful things <br> about the program. The entire <br> curriculum and staff 
    did not <br> disappoint. They were very hands-on <br> and I never had to wait long for <br> assistance. The agile team 
    project, in <br> particular, was outstanding. It took <br> my learning to the next level in a way <br> that no tutorial 
    could ever have. In <br> fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during <br> interviews as an example of my developent 
    experience.  It certainly <br> helped me land a job as a full-stack <br> developer after receiving multiple <br> offers. 
    100% recommend! ‚Äù</p>
